# **Aim**
To extract text from business card image(s), store it in the MySQL local server, and display extracted data using pandas.

## **Data Collection**
The data is collected from a [Google Drive source](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FhLOdeeQ4Bfz48JAfHrU_VXvNTRgajhp) with five+ business card templates.

## **Data Categorization**
The textual data typically includes information such as:
- **'Name of the business/person'** (Color: blue)
- **'Designation'** (Color: green)
- **'Phone numbers'** (Color: red)
- **'Email Id'** (Color: orange)
- **'Website'** (Color: purple)
- **'Address'** (Color: teal)

After extraction, the UI provides an option to either save or discard the data in the MySQL database server.

## **Supported Images**
The current version of the BizCard reader is compatible with images of the following extensions in formats:
- **'JPEG/JPG'** (Color: blue)
- **'PNG'** (Color: green)

## **Features**
- **Introduction**: App characteristics

- **Data Management**: Migration of the extracted data to MySQL (SQL)
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, pandas
